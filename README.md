Final projects for a FreeCodeCamp's course

The challenges are pretty simple, especially compared to the
responsive web design certification.

Description of each challenge:

    * Caesars Cipher: An Caesar's Cipher decoder on key 13. Everything is in
    caps and punctuation and spaces are maintained.

    * Palindrome Checker: A simple palindrome checker that ignores case,
    punctuation, spaces and symbols.

    * Roman Numeral Converter: The name says it all. Decimal to roman,
    with results in caps.

    * Telephone Number Validator: Checks if a string is a valid US phone number.

    * Cash Register: A function to generate change based on the payment, the value
    and the available bills/coins on the register.
